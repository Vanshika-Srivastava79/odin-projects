    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a delicious, savory dish that originated in Italy and has become
      a global favorite. It typically features a round, baked crust topped with
      tangy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and a variety of toppings like
      vegetables, meats, and herbs. Crispy on the outside and soft inside, pizza
      combines rich flavors and comforting warmth, making it perfect for any
      occasion—from quick snacks to shared meals with friends.
